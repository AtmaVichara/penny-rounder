# Penny Rounder
* Create a funciton called moneySplitter that takes two arguments (total, count) and splits the total, by the count, then returns split amounts in an array. Each value is rounded to the nearest 0.01
* Within moneySplitter() call a function that will split the total by the count. This function is named splitTotal() and takes total and count as argument variables
* Within moneySplitter() call a function to verify that the split total returned by splitTotal() adds up to the total passed into moneySplitter(). If it does not add or subtract 0.01 from each element until it equals the total.
* Return new array returned from verifySplit()
